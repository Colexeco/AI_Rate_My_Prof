# ProfEval

ProfEval is an AI powered Rate My Professor website. Professor Recommendations, Reviews and Suggestions at the tip of your fingertips.
It allows users to chat with an AI chat bot powered by OpenAI to get reviews, ratings, and suggestions on Professors they are interested in. If the professor they want to know more about is not available in our system, users can also add urls of those professors to add their information to our system! This is made possible with the help of RAG and webscraping.
